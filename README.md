# solidity2cpn
This repository is dedicated to our on-going work on the formal verification of Solidity smart contracts using Coloured Petri Nets. It will be frequently updated as we progress.
## Contents
- **case_studies/models:** this folder contains the CPN models of our Blind Auction use case, designed using *CPN Tools*.
- **case_studies/reports:** this folder contains the reports generated by *CPN Tools* for the state space analysis of our Blind Auction use case.
<!-- - **CPN Models/Helena:** this folder contains the CPN models of our Blind Auction use case, written in the syntax of *Helena*. -->
<!-- - **CPN Reports/Helena:** this folder contains the reports generated by *Helena* for the state space analysis of our Blind Auction use case. -->
- **src:** this folder contains the code for the prototype of our proposed Solidity-to-CPN transformation.
- **docs/Solidity2CPN:** this file contains extended content to our paper *A Solidity-to-CPN Approach Towards Formal Verification of Smart Contracts*.
